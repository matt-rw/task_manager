VIM NOTES:

vim moving keys: h (left) j (down) k (up) l (right)
CTRL-0 to jump back, e.g. go back to directory in vim
split to create new window; CTRL-W <moving key> to change window; close
args <file1> <file2> to open multiple files; wnext or wprevious for writing

forward one word (w), backward one word (b); specify number, e.g. 4w
forward to end of word (e), backward to end of word (ge)

f command searches forward in a line for a character, e.g. fx for x
F searches to the left; you can specify a count for f and F
t and T work like f and F except that it stops one character short
repeat with ; and repeat in the other direction with ,

$ goes to end of line; ^ goes to first character in line, 0 goes to start of line
% moves to the matching parenthesis in a pair, either open or close parenthesis; % also works for [] and {}

'9999k' goes to the top of the file; a number followed by j or k goes down or up that number of lines

G can follow a number to go to that line; e.g. 4G goes to line 4; G by itself goes to the end of the file
gg goes to the start of the file; so does 1G

move through a line with a number and %, e.g. 25% goes near the beginning while 75% goes near the end

H goes to Home (top of page), M goes to middle (of page), and L goes to Last (bottom of page, not file)

CTRL-U scrolls up  half a screen
CTRL-D scrolls down half a screen
CTRL-B scrolls up a whole screen
CTRL-F scrolls down a whole screen

zz moves screen to show context of cursor in the middle
xt does the same at the top; zb also but at the bottom

yy copies; specify number for copying multiple lines
dd cuts; similarly, specify number for multiple lines
p pastes
