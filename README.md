# Task Manager

Super simple way to keep track of previous tasks. I used this a lot when I was in school to see how much time I was spending on each subject.

UI/UX:
* Select add task
* Enter task name (e.g. ALGO)
* Click start
* Once finished, select end task
* View tasks for the current day or week
* Make a duration graph in the terminal for all activity with the task name

The code was written a long time ago and I have no desire to refactor. Apologies.
